## Background

I got the bug a few years ago that I wanted to do some more serious 'overlanding'. In particular, I wanted to do a solo, multi-day trip to Big Bend State Park to spend a few nights in the desert and experience the stars and silence. From what I understand from others, it's an experience like no other on the planet.

My conundrum at the time: Do I buy a new rig, or do I build out my POS Jeep Liberty for the job? 

After some research and test drives, I decided that I really do love my Liberty, it's entirely capable and the time and money would be better spend building the rig I wanted. So... that was that.

I had 3 main priorities:

1. Capability - I don't expect to do any hard-core rock crawling, but I felt the Jeep needed a bit more ground clearance and a better suspension to carry a heavy load.
2. Protection - My Libery, stock, didn't come with any armor. I'd need to fix that before I set out on any adventures in unfamiliar terrain that could potentially break something.
3. Recovery - As I was planning a solo trip, I wanted to be prepared to get myself out of any muddy or other situations I might inadvertently find myself in.

## Capability

I didn't write this up, but last year I gave the Liberty a 3" lift. I used Old Man Emu shocks and springs. The whole thing required buying tools I didn't already have, but once I did it went together pretty smoothly. The day-to-day ride quality is a bit stiffer, but I like it.

## Protection

Again, I didn't write this up, but after hunting for months on eBay and various online auto parts stores, I managed to piece together a full set of Jeep Liberty skid plates. Everything is MOPAR, except for the fuel tank skid plate that I had to order from <a href="https://www.asfir.com/fuel-tank-skid-plate-542071.html" target="_new">asfir.com</a>.
