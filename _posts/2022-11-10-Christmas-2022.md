## Thank you for another great Christmas!

2022 was our second year of putting on our Christmas light show for our friends and neighbors. It was great to have so many visitors. We're really glad so many of you were able to enjoy it. 

I make it a point to not come outside and bother our guests while they're watching. But there were a few times when I ran into some while taking pictures, videos or fixing something that wasn't working just right. The warm feedback I received about the show... well, it makes it all worth it! Thank you!

## Showtimes

At this point, the show is over. I may continue to play a few non-holiday songs on what remains until I get the entire display taken down. 

## Rules for Viewing

Whether you're thinking about stopping by or sitting in your car now, this would be a good time to take a look at the <a href="/lightshow/the_rules/">Rules for Viewing</a>.

## The Playlist
In case you missed this year's show, parts of it, or just want to see it again, here are videos of most of what we played.

Note that the songs are listed here in alphabetical order. The actual show will play randomly with no repeats.

**NOTE:** To avoid any claims of copyright infringement, I have removed all unlicensed content from these videos, but have provided YouTube links to the full experience, if you don't mind the ads. [More Info](/notices/re-audio-removal-from-videos/)

## Donate to the National MS Society

2023 will be the third year I've ridden the Texas MS150 charity ride.

If you enjoy the show and would like to show your appreciation, please consider helping us reach our fundraising goal by donating to the National MS Society to support their efforts to find a cure for multiple sclerosis and to help those affected by MS. 

Together, we can create a world free of MS! [Donate Now](https://mssociety.donordrive.com/participant/chadgoode)
