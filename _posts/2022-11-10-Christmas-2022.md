## Light Show On-Demand

To start the show, text the word <b>GO</b> to the number diplayed on the screen scrolling across the garage door.

Early in the season when there isn't much traffic, rather than leave the entire show playing to no one, the show will play <b>on-demand</b>. When you visit, you'll see instructions with a phone number to text the trigger code that will start the show automatically. 

Watch as long as you want and leave when you've had enough. If you don't stick around to see the whole thing, come back some other time. The songs will play at random. So while you may see some repeats on your second or third visits, there's a good chance you'll see something you missed.

## Donate to the National MS Society

2023 will be the third year I've ridden the Texas MS150 charity ride.

If you enjoy the show and would like to show your appreciation, please consider helping us reach our fundraising goal by donating to the National MS Society to support their efforts to find a cure for multiple sclerosis and to help those affected by MS. 

Together, we can create a world free of MS! [Donate Now](https://mssociety.donordrive.com/participant/chadgoode)
