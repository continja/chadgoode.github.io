## Earlier than expected, we're LIVE!

Everything is installed, tested and Halloween 2023 is ON!

## Light Show On-Demand

To start the show, text the word <b>GO</b> to the number scrolling across the garage door. 

Each on-demand request will play a limited number of songs from the full show. If it ends and you want to see more, text <b>GO</b> again to see the next set. Keep going until you start to see repeats, or come back another time to see the rest. There are about 20 songs in all.

Why? Early in the season when there isn't much traffic, we didn't want to just leave the show running for no one. We also found, as we add more songs, visitors tend to leave long before the full show ends, which again leaves it running for no one. We hope breaking the show into smaller sets will make it more enjoyable for everyone.

## Donate to the National MS Society

2024 will be my fourth year riding the Texas MS150 charity ride. In April, I will join thousands of other cyclists on a 2-day, 150 mile bike ride from Austin to College Station.

If you enjoy the show and would like to show your appreciation, please consider helping us reach our fundraising goal by donating to the National MS Society to support their efforts to find a cure for multiple sclerosis and to help those affected by MS. 

Together, we can create a world free of MS! [Donate Now](https://events.nationalmssociety.org/participant/chadgoode2024)
