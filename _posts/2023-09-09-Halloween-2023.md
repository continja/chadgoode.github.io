## Coming Soon

We've started installing lights on the house and making final tweaks to start the nightly show on Friday, October 6!

## Light Show On-Demand

Early in the season when there isn't much traffic, rather than leave the entire show playing to no one, the show will play <b>on-demand</b>. To start the show, text the word <b>GO</b> to the number scrollling across the garage door. 

Watch as long as you want and leave when you've had enough. If you don't stick around to see the whole thing, come back some other time. The songs will play at random. So while you may see some repeats on your second or third visits, there's a good chance you'll see something you missed.

## Where to See It

## Donate to the National MS Society

2024 will be my fourth year riding the Texas MS150 charity ride. In April, I will join thousands of other cyclists on a 2-day, 150 mile bike ride from Austin to College Station.

If you enjoy the show and would like to show your appreciation, please consider helping us reach our fundraising goal by donating to the National MS Society to support their efforts to find a cure for multiple sclerosis and to help those affected by MS. 

Together, we can create a world free of MS! [Donate Now](https://events.nationalmssociety.org/participant/chadgoode2024)
