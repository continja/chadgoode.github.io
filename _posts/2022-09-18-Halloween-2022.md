We're making the final preparations and starting to get things ready. We're on-track to go live on Friday, Oct 1.

There are some changes since last year, mostly adding a few things amounting to about 1000 more lights. I'm not going ruin the surprise, though. You'll have wait and see.

This year's show is over an hour long! It's a combination of new songs plus favorites from last year.

Early in the season when there isn't much traffic, rather than leave the entire show playing to no one, the show will be <b>on-demand</b> (like last year's Christmas show). When you visit, you'll see instructions with a phone number to text a trigger code that will start the show automatically. Watch as long as you want and leave when you've had enough. If you don't stick around to see the whole thing, come back some other time. The songs will play at random. So while you may see some repeats on your second or third visits, there's a good chance you'll see some you missed.

## Rules for Viewing

While you're waiting, and before you visit, this would be a good time to take a look at the <a href="/lightshow/the_rules/">Rules for Viewing</a>.

## Showtimes

Starting Friday, Oct 1, 2022, the show is available on-demand:

* Sunday thru Thursday: From sunset until 10pm.
* Friday and Saturday: From sunset until 11pm.

> NOTE: A running show may go past the above end times. However, no one will be able to trigger the show to start after that.

Starting Friday, Oct 21, the show will run continuously at the same times as above.

The final run will be Halloween night, Monday, Oct 31.
