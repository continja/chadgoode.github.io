## Light Show On-Demand

To start the show, text the word <b>GO</b> to the number diplayed on the screen scrolling across the garage door.

Early in the season when there isn't much traffic, rather than leave the entire show playing to no one, the show will play <b>on-demand</b>. When you visit, you'll see instructions with a phone number to text the trigger code that will start the show automatically. 

Watch as long as you want and leave when you've had enough. If you don't stick around to see the whole thing, come back some other time. The songs will play at random. So while you may see some repeats on your second or third visits, there's a good chance you'll see something you missed.

## Showtimes

During all times below, when the full show is not actively playing, a single song will play at random every 15 minutes.

Starting Friday, Oct 1, 2022, the show is available <b>on-demand</b>:

* Sunday thru Thursday: From sunset until 9pm.
* Friday and Saturday: From sunset until 11pm.

> NOTE: A running show may go past the above end times. However, no one will be able to start the show again after that.

Starting Friday, Oct 28, the show will run continuously from sunset until 12am.

The final run will be Halloween night, Monday, Oct 31 until 11pm.
