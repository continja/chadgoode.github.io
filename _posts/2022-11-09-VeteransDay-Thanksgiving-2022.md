Everything is nearly ready, and with any luck we'll be live with a special Veterans Day/Thanksgiving Show to go live Thursday, Nov 10 at sunset! At the time I'm writing this, that's less than 20 hours away. If I don't make it, we'll definitely be live Friday night.

**THURS UPDATE:** Not much luck. I finished installing right around sunset. But initial testing revealed a few problems that are going to require some work on Friday to fix. So... aiming for Friday!

**SAT UPDATE:** I got most of the problems worked out yesterday, and we're live as of last night. I had to order some new LED strips to repair my 'leaping arches'. Whether that gets fixed today or tomorrow depends on when those new lights arrive.

## Light Show On-Demand

To start the show, text the word <b>GO</b> to the number diplayed on the screen scrolling across the garage door.

Watch as long as you want and leave when you've had enough. If you don't stick around to see the whole thing, come back some other time. The songs will play at random. So while you may see some repeats on your second or third visits, there's a good chance you'll see something you missed.

## Where to See It
