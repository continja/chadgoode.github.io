This year, rather than start 'Christmas' *too early*, I put together a relatively short Veterans Day/Thanksgiving show. 

The [Christmas Show](/lightshow/Christmas-2023) will start Fri, Nov 24.

Enjoy!

## Light Show On-Demand

To start the show, text the word <b>GO</b> to the number diplayed on the screen scrolling across the garage door.

Watch as long as you want and leave when you've had enough. If you don't stick around to see the whole thing, come back some other time. The songs will play at random. So while you may see some repeats on your second or third visits, there's a good chance you'll see something you missed.

## Where to See It

Click <b><a onclick="document.getElementById('imgAddress').style.visibility='visible';">here</a></b> to see our address.

## Showtimes

Lights come on and sunset and will play randomly every 15 minutes until 9pm on school nights, and 10pm on Fri/Sat nights.

The on-demand service will also be turned on until 9pm on school nights, and 10pm on Fri/Sat nights.

Thanksgiving Day will be the final Veterans Day/Thanksgiving Show.
