I plan to start the transition to Christmas the first weekend of November. Once it's far enough along, we'll start playing a small 'Thanksgiving Show'. This will primarily of some fun Thanksgiving-related songs plus a few non-holiday specific songs from last year. The real Christmas show will start on Friday, Nov 26 at sunset.

## Light Show On-Demand

To start the show, text the word <b>GO</b> to the number diplayed on the screen scrolling across the garage door.

Early in the season when there isn't much traffic, rather than leave the entire show playing to no one, the show will play <b>on-demand</b>. When you visit, you'll see instructions with a phone number to text the trigger code that will start the show automatically. 

Watch as long as you want and leave when you've had enough. If you don't stick around to see the whole thing, come back some other time. The songs will play at random. So while you may see some repeats on your second or third visits, there's a good chance you'll see something you missed.
