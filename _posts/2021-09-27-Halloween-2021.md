Halloween 2021 was our first big light show. Seeing the kids' faces as they watched and danced really made all the time and every drop of sweat worth it.

## Teaser Videos

Seeing the show in person is a different experience than just watching the videos on YouTube. For one thing, it's really tough to reproduce the reds (they seem to come out orange and not look quite right). So, I held off on posting the show videos until just before Halloween night so I wouldn't give locals a reason not to come. However, I did post these teasers, which I'll leave up for now.
